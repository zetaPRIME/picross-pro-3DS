- implement crossing out
circle pad display (with mark/cross options)
implement 16px cell size... the sheer number of assets is going to be annoying :(

actual puzzle loading and handling, number display etc.

notes {
    Level loading from png (rgb for final color, a for whether space is filled in)
    Two grid sizes; 16x16px for <=10x10 grids, 12x12px for anything beyond
    Highlighted lines between every 5x5 section; round up to the next highest multiple of 5x5 and block out unused rows with mid-gray, just a bit darker than grid
}
